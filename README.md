# AlgoVisualizer

## Description

**AlgoVisualizer** is a Python application designed to visualize sorting algorithms through dynamic graphics. This educational tool will help you better understand how different sorting algorithms work by showing each step of the sorting process visually.

## Technologies Used

To develop this application, we will use the following technologies:

1. **Python**: The main language in which the application is written.
2. **Figma**: To create the prototypes and the overall design of the app.

## Features

- Step-by-step visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Control over animation speed.
- Generation of random data for sorting.
- Intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface.
- Simple explanations.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- (More algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc., will be added soon)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the development environment on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgoVisualizer.git
    cd AlgoVisualizer
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
